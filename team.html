<P>Think of the way most people live:

    They force themselves to wake up early in the morning, <br> dress up, drive straight to some workplace,<br>  spend 8 hours or so doing work they hate,<br>  drive back home, <br> surf the Internet or watch TV,<br>  and then go to sleep,<br>  only to repeat the same routine the next day for almost the rest of their lives.<br> 
    
    In our culture, we consider this kind of living as normal and even healthy,<br>  but if you stop and think about it,<br>  it’s not healthy at all. Rather,<br>  it’s sick.
    
    Life can be immensely beautiful,<br>  yet instead of making the most out of it living in joy and peace, <br> we waste it living in suffering and conflict.<br>  That’s because we’ve been programmed to believe that this is the only way to live. <br> Habits,<br>  tradition and dogmatic beliefs have turned us into<br>  mindless automatons that follow a predetermined path that was forced upon us.
    
    This programming, however, can be broken,<br>  if we realize that it’s in our hands to change the way we live,<br>  and gather enough courage in our hearts to rebel against the sickness of our culture. <br> If you feel ready to embark on a journey of<br>  liberation and discovery, <br> here are the eight most important things you can do right now to <br>deprogram yourself and escape the matrix<br> you’ve been trapped in since <br>the very day you were born</P>
