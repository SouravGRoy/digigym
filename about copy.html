    <p class="para2">Exercise can help prevent excess weight gain or help maintain weight loss. When you engage in physical activity, you burn calories. The more intense the activity, the more calories you burn.
    
        Regular trips to the gym are great, but don't worry if you can't find a large chunk of time to exercise every day. Any amount of activity is better than none at all. To reap the benefits of exercise, just get more active throughout your day — take the stairs instead of the elevator or rev up your household chores. Consistency is key.</p>

    There's a reason so many New Year's resolutions <br> to get in shape crash and burn before February rolls around. <br> And it's not that you simply don't have what it takes. <br> Science shows us that there's a right way to build habits that last. <br> Follow these steps to make exercise one of them.
    <br>

Start small and build momentum <br>
A goal of exercising for 30 minutes a day, <br> 5 times a week may sound good. <br> But how likely are you to follow through? <br> The more ambitious your goal, <br> the more likely you are to fail, <br> feel bad about it, <br> and give up. <br> It's better to start with easy exercise goals you know you can achieve. <br> As you meet them, <br> you'll build self-confidence and momentum. <br> Then you can move on to more challenging goals.
<br>
Make it automatic with triggers <br>
Triggers are one of the secrets to success when it comes to forming an exercise habit. <br> In fact, research shows that the most consistent exercisers rely on them. <br> Triggers are simply reminders—a time of day, <br> place, or cue—that kick off an automatic reaction. <br>
They put your routine on autopilot,<br> so there's nothing to think about or decide on.<br> The alarm clock goes off and you're out the door for your walk. <br>You leave work for the day and head straight to the gym.<br> You spot your sneakers right by the bed and you're up and running. <br>Find ways to build them into your day to <br>make exercise a no-brainer.
<br>
Reward yourself
